- This project helped me further my skills with Android development and to learn new concepts such as:
	- Multi-threaded applications
	- Become proficient with open source APIs
	- Store array data structures in Android's preferences by Serializing the object into a string
	- De-Serializing a string representation of our data to load it from our app preferences.
